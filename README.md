Testing: .\dvwa\vulnerabilities\exec\source\high.php
Title: Command Injection Vulnerability
Description: The code is a PHP script that takes an IP address as input and executes a ping command on it. The script uses a blacklist array to remove certain characters from the input before executing the command.
Issue: The script is vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker can bypass the blacklist by using different variations of the characters or by using other characters that are not in the blacklist. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
Threat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the server or to execute malicious code on the server. This can lead to data theft, data loss, or system compromise.
Proof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can submit the following input as the IP address: `127.0.0.1; ls`. This will execute the `ls` command on the server and list the contents of the current directory. A bash script to test the vulnerability is as follows:


#!/bin/bash

curl -X POST \
  http://example.com/script.php \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'ip=127.0.0.1%3B%20ls&Submit=Submit'


Taint Analysis: The input is tainted because it is not properly sanitized before being used in a shell command. The blacklist array is not sufficient to prevent command injection attacks.
Recommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the input should be properly sanitized using a whitelist approach. Only allow input that matches a specific pattern, such as an IP address. The shell_exec() function should also be avoided if possible, as it is prone to command injection attacks. Instead, use a safer alternative such as the exec() function with proper arguments. The remediated code is as follows:


<?php

if( isset( $_POST[ 'Submit' ]  ) ) {
        // Get input
        $target = trim($_REQUEST[ 'ip' ]);

        // Validate input
        if (filter_var($target, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)) {
                // Execute the ping command.
                if( stristr( php_uname( 's' ), 'Windows NT' ) ) {
                        // Windows
                        $cmd = exec( 'ping ' . escapeshellarg($target) );
                }
                else {
                        // *nix
                        $cmd = exec( 'ping -c 4 ' . escapeshellarg($target) );
                }

                // Feedback for the end user
                $html .= "<pre>{$cmd}</pre>";
        } else {
                $html .= "<pre>Invalid input</pre>";
        }
}

?>


Taxonomy: The vulnerability can be classified as CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') and CAPEC-88: Command Injection.
CVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High).

Title: Command Injection Vulnerability
Description: The code is a PHP script that takes an IP address as input, checks if it is valid, and then executes a ping command on the IP address.
Issue: The code is vulnerable to command injection attacks because it uses user input directly in a shell command without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the $target variable and execute them on the server.
Threat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the server, which can lead to data theft, system compromise, and other malicious activities.
Proof of Concept: An attacker can inject a command by entering a malicious IP address in the input field. For example, an attacker can enter `127.0.0.1; ls -la` as the IP address. This will execute the `ls -la` command on the server. A bash script to test this vulnerability is:


#!/bin/bash
curl -X POST http://example.com/script.php -d "ip=127.0.0.1; ls -la&user_token=abc&session_token=def&Submit=Submit"


Taint Analysis: The user input is directly used in a shell command without proper sanitization or validation. This makes the vulnerability easily exploitable.

Recommendation: To remediate this vulnerability, the user input must be properly sanitized and validated before being used in a shell command. One way to do this is to use the escapeshellarg() function to escape the user input. The fixed code should look like this:


if( ( is_numeric( $octet[0] ) ) && ( is_numeric( $octet[1] ) ) && ( is_numeric( $octet[2] ) ) && ( is_numeric( $octet[3] ) ) && ( sizeof( $octet ) == 4 ) ) {
    // If all 4 octets are int's put the IP back together.
    $target = $octet[0] . '.' . $octet[1] . '.' . $octet[2] . '.' . $octet[3];

    // Escape the user input
    $target = escapeshellarg($target);

    // Determine OS and execute the ping command.
    if( stristr( php_uname( 's' ), 'Windows NT' ) ) {
        // Windows
        $cmd = shell_exec( 'ping  ' . $target );
    }
    else {
        // *nix
        $cmd = shell_exec( 'ping  -c 4 ' . $target );
    }

    // Feedback for the end user
    $html .= "<pre>{$cmd}</pre>";
}


Taxonomy: This vulnerability can be classified as CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') and CAPEC-88: Command Injection.

CVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High). The vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

Testing: .\dvwa\vulnerabilities\exec\source\low.php
Title: Command Injection Vulnerability
Description: The code is a PHP script that takes an IP address as input and executes a ping command on it. The output of the command is then displayed to the user.
Issue: The code is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The user input is directly passed to the shell_exec() function without any sanitization or validation. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands in the input and execute them on the server.
Threat Model: The vulnerability can be exploited using the Injection technique of the STRIDE methodology.
Proof of Concept: An attacker can inject a command by adding a semicolon (;) followed by the command they want to execute. For example, if the attacker inputs "127.0.0.1; ls -la", the server will execute both the ping command and the ls command, and the output of both commands will be displayed to the user. A bash script to test the vulnerability is:


#!/bin/bash
curl -X POST -d "ip=127.0.0.1; ls -la" http://example.com/ping.php


Taint Analysis: The user input is tainted and directly passed to the shell_exec() function, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks.

Recommendation: To fix the vulnerability, the user input should be sanitized and validated before passing it to the shell_exec() function. One way to do this is to use the escapeshellarg() function to escape any special characters in the input. The fixed code would look like:


if( isset( $_POST[ 'Submit' ]  ) ) {
        // Get input
        $target = $_REQUEST[ 'ip' ];

        // Sanitize input
        $target = escapeshellarg($target);

        // Determine OS and execute the ping command.
        if( stristr( php_uname( 's' ), 'Windows NT' ) ) {
                // Windows
                $cmd = shell_exec( 'ping  ' . $target );
        }
        else {
                // *nix
                $cmd = shell_exec( 'ping  -c 4 ' . $target );
        }

        // Feedback for the end user
        $html .= "<pre>{$cmd}</pre>";
}


Taxonomy: The vulnerability is a Command Injection (CWE-78) and can be exploited using the Command Injection (CAPEC-88) technique.

CVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High).

Testing: .\dvwa\vulnerabilities\exec\source\medium.php
Title: Command Injection Vulnerability
Description: The code is a PHP script that takes an IP address as input and executes a ping command on it. The script uses shell_exec() function to execute the ping command.
Issue: The script does not validate the user input and directly passes it to the shell_exec() function. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the target system.
Threat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology as follows:
- Spoofing: An attacker can spoof the IP address and execute arbitrary commands on the target system.
- Tampering: An attacker can tamper with the input and inject arbitrary commands.
- Repudiation: An attacker can execute commands on the target system without leaving any trace, making it difficult to attribute the attack.
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can execute commands that reveal sensitive information on the target system.
- Denial of Service: An attacker can execute commands that cause the target system to crash or become unresponsive.
- Elevation of Privilege: An attacker can execute commands with elevated privileges on the target system.

Proof of Concept: An attacker can inject a command by submitting the following input in the 'ip' field:
127.0.0.1; ls -la
This will execute the 'ls -la' command on the target system.

To test the vulnerability, the following bash script can be used:

#!/bin/bash
curl -X POST -d "ip=127.0.0.1; ls -la" http://example.com/script.php

This will send a POST request to the vulnerable script with the injected command.

Taint Analysis: The user input is directly passed to the shell_exec() function without any validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to command injection.

Recommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the user input should be validated and sanitized before passing it to the shell_exec() function. One way to do this is to use the escapeshellarg() function to escape any special characters in the input. The fixed code would look like this:

if( isset( $_POST[ 'Submit' ]  ) ) {
        // Get input
        $target = $_REQUEST[ 'ip' ];

        // Validate and sanitize input
        if (preg_match('/^[0-9\.]+$/', $target)) {
                $target = escapeshellarg($target);

                // Determine OS and execute the ping command.
                if( stristr( php_uname( 's' ), 'Windows NT' ) ) {
                        // Windows
                        $cmd = shell_exec( 'ping  ' . $target );
                }
                else {
                        // *nix
                        $cmd = shell_exec( 'ping  -c 4 ' . $target );
                }

                // Feedback for the end user
                $html .= "<pre>{$cmd}</pre>";
        } else {
                $html .= "Invalid input";
        }
}

This code validates the input using a regular expression to ensure that it only contains digits and dots. It then uses the escapeshellarg() function to escape any special characters in the input before passing it to the shell_exec() function.

Taxonomy: The vulnerability can be classified as CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') and CAPEC-88: Command Injection.

CVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High). The vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
